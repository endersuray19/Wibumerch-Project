The figure features Black Rock Shooter in a dynamic pose rushing through crumbling debris, her beautifully sculpted body appearing both fragile and immensely strong at the same time. Black Rock Shooter is carrying her Rock Cannon, which almost appears as though it is floating in midair, while blue flame accents decorate the base of the figure. From top to bottom, the figure features a ton of eye-catching details you can only find in 3D form. Crossing through time and dimensions, the blue flame is headed to you.`,

"Learning to live on my own is my way of repaying his kindness." From the anime series "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End" comes a vignette-style figure of the mage Fern! A beautiful butterfly, symbolic of Fern's precious memories with her loved ones, perches on her fingertip. Fern's gentle and charming expression as she gazes at the butterfly provides a fitting visual representation of her kind and tender personality. Her fluttering robe, delicate long hair, as well as the vignette base featuring a clear stream and flowers work hand in hand to create a quiet and serene display. The texture of the base and outfit, the warmth of the wooden staff and the elegant shine of the silver decorations have been carefully brought to life with skillful paintwork and sculpting. The result is a stunning figure that can be enjoyed not only as a whole, but also as a collection of individual eye-catching details. Be sure to add the beautiful scene to your collection!`,
